## Dashboard Theme

During the initial discovery workshop, different views for different types of users was the most common feature that was requested. Since the app is essentially a booking system, different views for users with different needs made sense. Thus, a dashboard for each of the three user types (student, tutor, exec team) was the route we chose to go.
